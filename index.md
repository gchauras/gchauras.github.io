I work at [Meta]'s [Superintelligence Labs] on LLM post-training and AI Agents, focussing
on agents to automate highly complex ML engineering and research tasks.

I was previously part of [Oculus], which later became [Meta]'s Reality Labs division, where I shipped mixed reality and spatial AI on Quest 1,
2, Pro, 3, 3s; and contributed to changing the Quest line from VR to Mixed Reality.

My key research interests these days include:
- AI agents for automating SW / ML engineering,
- Infrastructure for running and benchmarking AI agents,
- LLM post training and reinforcement learning recipes,
- 3D vision, real time rendering and ML for AR/VR experiences.

I was a postdoc first at [MIT] with [Fredo Durand] and [Sylvain Paris],
and then in the vision and robotics group at [Disney Research Zurich]. I completed
my PhD under the guidance of [George Drettakis] at [INRIA] in the beautiful French
Riviera. I obtained my Masters degree in computer science at [ENSIMAG]. In an
earlier life, I used to be an undergrad at [Indian Institute of Technology Delhi].
