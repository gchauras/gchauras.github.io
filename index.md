I work at [Oculus] on VR and related problems.
I was a postdoc first at [MIT] with [Fredo Durand] and [Sylvain Paris],
and then in the vision and robotics group at [Disney Research Zurich]. I completed
my PhD under the guidance of [George Drettakis] at [INRIA] in the beautiful French
Riviera. I obtained my Masters degree in computer science at [ENSIMAG]. In an
earlier life, I used to be an undergrad at [Indian Institute of Technology Delhi].
